# Rava, the Run Tracker app!

![app logo](/public/images/ravaLogo.png)

Rava is a run tracker app that helps users log their runs and keep track of their progress. It tracks running data like pace, calories burned, average heart rate, notes, etc.! It organizes run data into a clear, easy to read format so that users can easily review their progress over time. 

The app also provides a simple and encouraging community function, so users can view others' runs and feel inspired and stay accountable. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced runner, Rava welcomes runners of all levels, paces, and goals to track their progress and stay motivated!

## Background Information

I created Rava because I wanted a simple, no-pressure way to track my runs without getting overwhelmed by data. Most fitness apps felt too complicated or competitive, and I just wanted something that helped me stay consistent and reflect on my progress. I also wanted a space to jot down how I felt after each run â€” physically or mentally. Rava was built with that in mind: a clean, personal running log for anyone on their own unique journey.

## Getting Started
[Project Planning](https://trello.com/b/E8yYMec3/run-tracker-app)

Here's a look at the project planning process. 

I focused on user stories and thinking about what a user would like to see if they were using a run tracker app. Then, I built out the wireframes of how the website would look like once built out. I also added a few stretch goals that I would like to see after MVP completion.
